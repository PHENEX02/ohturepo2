Create User

    [Documentation]  This keyword creates a new user with the specified username and password.
    # Assuming that the Create User keyword interacts with the system to register a user

    # Example:
    # Send request to create user API or interact with UI form, etc.
    Log  Creating user with username: ${username} and password: ${password}
    # You can insert API calls or UI interactions here depending on the system youâ€™re testing.

Output Should Contain
    [Arguments]  ${expected_output}
    [Documentation]  This keyword checks if the expected output is present in the response or UI after submitting the credentials.
    # Assuming that the system provides feedback (such as in a UI or via an API response)
